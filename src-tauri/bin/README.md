## Windows

PDU Version: 0.8.4
Using the GNU toolchain build for .exe (Window) renamed as "pdu-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe" (and not pdu-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.exe), in this way there is no dependency on Visual C++ Redistributable.

## Mac

PDU Version: 0.8.4
Cloning the "pdu-x86_64-apple-darwin" to "pdu-aarch64-apple-darwin" since there is no ARM build up to now of PDU.
